# DoSelect for Developers

Source code for [developers.doselect.com](http://developers.doselect.com).

## Development

This website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static-site generator, which is written in Golang. After you've cloned this repo, you need to set up Hugo locally, by following [this](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) guide. Once you've done that, and have `hugo` in your `$PATH`, you're good to go!

Start hugo development server using `hugo server` at the root of this repo, and open the browser at [localhost:1313](http://lcoalhost:1313).
